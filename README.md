# 🎯 SPM CEFR English Grade Calculator

This is a free and simple web app designed to help Form 5 students estimate their **SPM English CEFR grade** based on marks from all four papers:

- ✅ Paper 1: Reading (40 marks)
- ✍️ Paper 2: Writing (60 marks)
- 🗣️ Paper 3: Speaking (24 marks)
- 🎧 Paper 4: Listening (30 marks)

Each paper contributes **25%** to the final grade. The app also includes **ETR (Estimated To Reach)**, which shows how many marks are needed in the remaining papers to hit a target score.
